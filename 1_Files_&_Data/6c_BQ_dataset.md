# BigQuery SQL Datasets & More Query Info

### Why do this
 - **Learn** SQL query concepts so that you can use Google Cloud Big Query service using your own version of my source data (CSV files)
 - **Practice** SQL query concepts by writing & executing queries against BigQuery datasets

### Create your own example BigQuery Dataset

 If you want to set up your own copy of the example BigQuery dataset, use the CSV files provided [in this Repository](https://github.com/lynnlangit/gcp-for-bioinformatics/tree/master/1_Files_%26_Data/genomic-data-samples/CSV-or-TXT/CSV-for-BigQuery-lessons)
  - GET your source files or use my CSV files
  - OPEN each CSV files to... 
    - review/update the file structure 
    - review/update the data 
    - SAVE each file
  - CREATE a BigQuery dataset using the Web UI
    - CREATE one BigQuery table for each CSV file inside of your BQ Dataset
      - To create table schema
        - enter each column name and data type manually --or-- 
        - use BigQuery 'auto-detect' table schema IF all of the following conditions are met:
          - DELIMETERS - your source files use tab, comma or pipe delimeters 
          - DATA TYPES - each file must have at least one non-string column, i.e. integer, float, date
          - HEADERS - you can set to skip 1 row if your source data has headers
          - WHITE SPACE (in string data type columns)BigQuery INCLUDES all white space in string fields, so if you want to remove that white space you must remove it in the source file before you create your BigQuery tables

Review the example BigQuery dataset schema and example data (graphic below)

### How to verify you've done it
 - View the dataset in your Bigquery tree (see below)
 - Click on each table to verify schema and data

### Other Things to Know
 - Your BQ dataset is set by default to only be accessible by you within your GCP project.  If you want to make this dataset available to other GCP others, then you must manually set the access permissions on your BQ dataset.
 - SQL is a set-based query language for data tables 
 - Joining table rows is a key concept. The graphic below shows join concepts

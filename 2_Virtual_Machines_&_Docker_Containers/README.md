# Use GCP for Virtual Machines & Docker Containers

In this section, you'll get information about using GCP services to run Virtual Machines (VMs) or docker container images on GCP.  You'll use Google Compute Engine VMsm, which are called Google Compute Engine (GCE) instances.  Additionally you can use services to orchestrate clusters of VMs or docker containers such as Google Kubernetes Engine (or K8).  

Alternatively you can use bioinformatics pipeline & workflow languages and services to coordinate groups of VMs or containers.  These APIs include WDL/cromwell, Nextflow and others.

You'll also see how to create a Notebook VM instance using a GCP template, so that you can use a Jupyter notebook for your analysis job.

# USE AlphaFold for Protein Folding Prediction

### Why do this
 - USE AlphaFold and GCP Vertex AI for efficient protein folding prediction. Once a proteinâ€™s structure is determined and its role within the cell is understood, scientists can develop drugs that can modulate the protein function based on its role in the cell

### What is this
 - AlphaFold is a machine learning model (uses TensorFlow) created by Google DeepMind. Here's a 7 minute video on AlphaFold concepts, including running it on GCP Vertex AI - [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX0BTkimL7A)

### Key considerations

You can run AlphaFold using example notebooks (small-sized test) or via a scalable cloud-based machine learning pipeline.
- SMALL: 
  - Use **Colabs** [very small example notebook - here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb). Runs in 5 minutes on default Colab env.
  - Use **Colabs** [small sample notebook - here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepmind/alphafold/blob/main/notebooks/AlphaFold.ipynb). Runs in ~ 30 minutes. Example notebook output shown below. --or-- 
  - Use Vertex AI Notebook to test [example notebook - here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/vertex-ai-samples/blob/main/community-content/alphafold_on_workbench/AlphaFold.ipynb). 
- SCALABLE/ LARGE: 
  - Use Vertex AI (batch) Pipeline to scale - [link](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/alphafold-batch-inference-with-vertex-ai-pipelines)

# Use Google Cloud Services for Machine Learning

In this section, you'll get information about using Google Cloud services for machine learning.  
- You'll use BigQuery Machine Learning
- Also you'll use Google ML APIs and services
- Additionally you'll use Google Colabs to run BigQuery ML jobs in a Jupyter notebook
- Useful presentation on notebook options for GCP - [link](https://mco.dev/so-many-notebooks-so-little-time.../)

NOTE: Right click on the 'Open in Colab' button at the top of the *.ipynb (IPython notebook file) and 'open link in a new tab' as directly opening this link is blocked in GitHub.

### For More Information

I created an entire course on LinkedIn Learning on GCP Machine Learning.  Also I published a GitHub Repo with code samples for GCP Machine Learning services - [link](https://github.com/lynnlangit/gcp-ml) for more advanced machine learning scenarios.

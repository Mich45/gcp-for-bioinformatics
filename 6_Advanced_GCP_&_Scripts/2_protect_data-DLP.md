#  Protect Data with DLP

## What is it?

Cloud Data Loss Prevention (DLP) is a fully managed service designed to help you discover, classify, and protect your most sensitive data.

Discover where sensitive data is located across your enterprise. Conduct continuous profiling to see a high-level overview and then perform -in-depth scans on tables of interest. Once you've discovered where the sensitive data is, you can then take steps to protect it.

# Style Guide

We love contributions!  Here are some tips for creating contributions to this open source course.

## General Approaches

Use **active voice**, i.e. 'you will click..., you learn to create..., etc...' rather than passive voice 'clicking x results in y...'  
Start blocks with active **VERBS in ALL CAPS**, i.e. 'USE..., LEARN...' , rather than 'using x does y' or 'x results in z'.  
Use **hierarchies and lists** to convey structure, i.e...
- 1 DO something...
    - 1a DO this task to do this thing
    - 1b DO the next task to do this thing
- 2 DO something else...
    - 2a DO this task to do this thing
    - 2b DO the next task to do this thing
    - 2c DO the next-next task to do this thing
- 3 DO something else again...
    - 3a DO this task to do this thing
    - 3b DO the next task to do this thing

## Sections Headings

The section headings on each page are the same by design, i.e. 

- **Why do this**  
    - Text here...(reasons to use this service for researchers)
- **What is this**  
    - Text here...(quick service description)
...  
- **How to do this**
    - Text here...(step-by-step instructions using the GCP console)  
- **How to verify you've done it** 
    - Text here...(what to review to verify that you've been able to use the service )  
...  
- **How to learn more**
    - Text here...(links - use icons by content type, shown below)  
        1. üìó READ - one page of this Repo (MD page)
        2. üì∫ WATCH -  linked YouTube screencasts
        3. üìô TRY - Jupyter Notebook example
        4. :octocat: TRY - linked GitHub Repos
        5. üìò EXPAND - linked (external) resources
        6. üîç SCAN - search a list in this Repo

----

## Keep Pull Requests small  
- one PR per page of this repo 
    - do not combine PRs, i.e. one big PR with updates x multiple pages
    - follow the style and structure of each page - add new or updated info only
- if correcting typos 
    - make that one PR 
    - separate it from additions to the text

## Content principles
All written content should follow these principles:

* **Approachability:** Don't assume reader has prior knowledge, spell out all acronyms
* **Brevity:** Keep it simple, link to outside content for deeper dives
* **Curation:** Amplify community best practices vs. any individual's point of view

Content should maintain a quickly scanable tone. This course is meant as an introduction to using GCP services for those who are new to cloud and working in bioinformatics research.
